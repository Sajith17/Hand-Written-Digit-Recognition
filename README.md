# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition

## Overview

**Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition** lets users input handwritten digits, and the model predicts the corresponding digit.

I utilized **TensorFlow 2** for its robust deep learning capabilities, enabling efficient development, training, and deployment of the CNN model. Additionally, **Flask** was chosen to showcase the working due to its lightweight, modular framework, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly web interface.

I encountered several challenges, including a **limited quantity of custom data** and **suboptimal accuracy within my custom hand-drawn dataset**. To overcome these challenges, I initially **pretrained the model** on the MNIST dataset and subsequently **fine-tuned it** using my custom dataset.
